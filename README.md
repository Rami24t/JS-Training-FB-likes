# JS-Training-FB-likes

## Practicing some js by solving the 'Who likes it?' challenge from codewars:

'''
In the "like" system from pages like facebook people can "like" posts, pictures or other items. 
Your function should create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item and returns the display text as shown in these examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"

["Botros"]                         -->  "Botros likes this"

["Gallops", "Alex"]                 -->  "Gallops and Alex like this"

["Maxi", "Johanna", "Markus"]           -->  "Maxi, Johanna and Markus like this"

["Ella", "Bob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Ella, Bob and 2 others like this"

['Rami', 'Jacob', 'Mark', 'Max','Kristie','Christie','Lewak','Brita','Erico', 'Dani'] --> 'Rami, Jacob and 8 others like this'
